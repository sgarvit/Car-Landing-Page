                    <h1>Involvement in the arts</h1>
                    <p>In 1975, sculptor Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the BMW 3.0 CSL racing car driven by
                        Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which became the first in the series of BMW Art Cars.
                        Since Calder's work of art, many other renowned artists throughout the world have created BMW
                        Art Cars, including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank
                        Stella, and Andy Warholoverseas To date, a total of 19 BMW Art Cars, based on both racing and
                        regular production vehicles, have been created.</p>
